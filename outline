twas the night before christmas, and all through the house
not a creature was stirring, except an elf on a shelf. 
The stockings were hung by the chminey with care, 
in hopes that st. nicholas soon would be there. 
The puppy was nestled, all snug in her bed, 
while visions of rawhide danced in her head. 
And Parker in her sleeper snuggled up on Dad's chest, 
had just settled down for a long winter's rest. 
When out in the living room there arose such a clatter, 
i sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. 
Away down the hallway avoiding the clutter, 
I grabbed for my camera and openned the shutter. 
When what to my wondering eyes should appear 
but some mischevious elves, i had heard to fear. 
Their eyes how they twinkled, their dimples how merry, 
thier cheeks a dozen roses, thier noses like cherries. 
the one in the back had undone a roll, 
to cover the tree, that was her goal. 
a round the record player one started to spin, 
tangled in ribbon, right up to her chin. 
the elf in the center had syrup to taste, 
she shoved the whole bottle into her face. 
climbing into a stocking, an elf lost her hat, 
she folded right over to reach for it back.  
the elf right up front had toppled a tree, 
she looked right up and shouted with glee
the last little elf, had opened a box. 
she tore through the paper as quick as a fox. 
they were sprightly and plump, right jolly young elfs, 
and i laughed when i saw them in spite of myself. 
I took out my camera before they could dash
Then they were gone right after the flash.
I laughed to my self as I walked back to bed
I thought I heard something and tilted my head
There was a small voice if I listened just right
cheering Merry Christmas to all and to all and Good Night.
